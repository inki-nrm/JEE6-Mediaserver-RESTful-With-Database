JEE6-Mediaserver-RESTful-With-Database
======================================

Projects, Maven based. 1-Server 1-Domain 1-J2SE-Client  Able to run in Netbeans 7.3.1 and Glassfish 3.x      Problem with Restful and Glassfish 4.x.  Here I only use 2 domain-classes: The MEDIA and the IMAGE, not using the METADATA and the MEDIATEXT.      have not solved the @embeddeble technique for now.
